# gtestcert

`gtestcert` is a simple tool based on [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for making development certificates trusted by [GTestCA](https://gtestca.nat.gov.tw/). It requires no configuration.

```
$ gtestcert -install
Created a new local CA üí•
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! ü¶ä

$ gtestcert example.com "*.example.com" example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "example.com"
 - "*.example.com"
 - "example.test"
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"
 - "::1"

The certificate is at "./example.com+5.pem" and the key at "./example.com+5-key.pem" ‚úÖ
```

Using certificates from real certificate authorities (CAs) for development can be dangerous or impossible (for hosts like `example.test`, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors. Managing your own CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands, specialized knowledge and manual steps.

gtestcert automatically installs the GTestRCA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. gtestcert does not automatically configure servers to use the certificates, though, that's up to you.

## Installation

Follow the installation instruction from [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to install prerequisites for your operating system.

Use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/tan9/gtestcert/releases).

If you're running into permission problems try running `gtestcert` as an Administrator.

## Supported root stores

gtestcert supports the following root stores:

* macOS system store
* Windows system store
* Linux variants that provide either
    * `update-ca-trust` (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS) or
    * `update-ca-certificates` (Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, SLES) or
    * `trust` (Arch)
* Firefox (macOS and Linux only)
* Chrome and Chromium
* Java (when `JAVA_HOME` is set)

To only install the local root CA into a subset of them, you can set the `TRUST_STORES` environment variable to a comma-separated list. Options are: "system", "java" and "nss" (includes Firefox).

## Advanced topics

### Advanced options

```
	-cert-file FILE, -key-file FILE, -p12-file FILE
	    Customize the output paths.

	-client
	    Generate a certificate for client authentication.

	-ecdsa
	    Generate a certificate with an ECDSA key.

	-pkcs12
	    Generate a ".p12" PKCS #12 file, also know as a ".pfx" file,
	    containing certificate and key for legacy applications.

	-csr CSR
	    Generate a certificate based on the supplied CSR. Conflicts with
	    all other flags and arguments except -install and -cert-file.
```

> **Note:** You _must_ place these options before the domain names list.

#### Example

```
gtestcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem example.com *.example.com
```

### Mobile devices

For the certificates to be trusted on mobile devices, you will have to install the root CA. It's the `rootCA.pem` file in the folder printed by `gtestcert -CAROOT`.

On iOS, you can either use AirDrop, email the CA to yourself, or serve it from an HTTP server. After opening it, you need to [install the profile in Settings > Profile Downloaded](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/233#issuecomment-690110809) and then [enable full trust in it](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT204477).

For Android, you will have to install the CA and then enable user roots in the development build of your app. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22040887/749014).

### Using the root with Node.js

Node does not use the system root store, so it won't accept gtestcert certificates automatically. Instead, you will have to set the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file) environment variable.

```
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$(gtestcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem"
```
